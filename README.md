# Basket Order App

This project was inspired by a family member's current personal business and the possibility associated with creating a website for it. This business involves managing and cultivating small agricultural terrains, producing a variety of products and selling them in baskets.

So, this represents what could be a template for a website or web app that would not only serve the purpose of advertising the business, but also serve as a better way for customers to order their baskets.

Note: Because of time constrains, the current layout and design is only really suitable for larger screen sizes.

## Development

This project was built using popular web development tools that I was somewhat comfortable with and others that I got to know better and were appropriate for the job:

- Typescript, HTML, CSS;
- React & Redux;
- Next.js (with MongoDB);
- Vercel (for deployment);

### Design

Not being a designer, coming up with a look for this project was definitely a challenge and something that took some time. For the most part, I had an idea of the main content I wanted and some general design ideas. After that, I manly researched about common and "correct" practices and looked at many examples for inspiration. The current design tries to follow some of those popular practices while keeping a relatively simple but functional look.

(While understanding the importance of making responsive websites, to avoid spending even more time coming up with a design that also worked on smaller screen sizes, for now, this website is optimized for larger screens.)

### Roadmap

Because the initial idea for this project was related to a relatively small business, there are some common features that weren't deemed as absolutely necessary but would make sense in the context of the project. Thus, the current state of the project contemplates a basic set of features and functionalities, mainly for advertising the business and allowing customers to make their orders.

So, as part of a possible roadmap, there are some other features and functionalities that are not yet present and might be added in the future, like:

- Fix layout to be responsive (only works in larger screen sizes);
- Support for proper user authentication, allowing for customer profiles and, for example, keeping track of past orders;
- Support for integrated payment methods;
- Choosing different languages (for example, Portuguese and English);
- Choosing different website color themes (light or dark);
